# HadoopDupData
Objetive: Duplicate transaction datasets (ex in fimi.ua.ac.be/data/) in Hadoop MapReduce.
For each duplication, length of transactions is preserved but items are swapped randomly, so there is no duplication of transaction.
Input:
- dataset location in HDFS
- n: number of duplications
- output location
